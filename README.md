# Remedic hospital-management (work in progress)
A Lot of Health Facilities out there has a breach between their users and the hospital staffs, 
i found out a lot while carrying out a research and i am trying to breach this gap or should i say loop hole i found in every hospital management system.

# This Software would have 3 parts
1. A Website where the hospital can communicate with its users from the comfort of their home (....more to come)
2. A Management Level System this would be used by the hospital staffs like Doctors, Nurse, Surgeons, Receptionist (...more to come)
3. An API, This would allow the system to also be available on other platforms like Android, IOS so it would not be limited to web alone(...more to come)

<!-- The User Website  -->
# The User Website Here the user can view about the hospital make appointment as seen on the navbar
